                        DDS. However, USA dental schools award either DDS or DMD based on school norms.
                        Both the degrees are equivalent and dentists with these degrees considered as general
                        dentists. Moreover, US domestic students pursue 4 years (D1, D2, D3, D4) of education
                        and international students pursue at least 2 years (D3, D4) to attain DMD/DDS degree.</p></li>

                        (D3, D4) to get the DMD/DDS degree even though students pursued for 4-6 years back
                       at their home countries. Students who get DDS/ DMD from the dental school in the USA
                       are eligible to practice in all 50 states &amp; Washington D.C. of the America. International
                       dentists should pursue the program from school which is accredited by the Commission
